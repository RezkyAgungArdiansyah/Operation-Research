### [simplex method](https://github.com/RezkyAgungArdiansyah/Operation-Research/blob/main/LPSimpleksMethod) and [big - M](https://github.com/RezkyAgungArdiansyah/Operation-Research/blob/main/LPBigMMethod) method

* simpleks method is popular method to solve linear programing, the step to use this code is :
1. it will ask to how many the constraints do you have..
2. next it will ask you to input what is your objective function, eg. 2x1+3x2 ==> [2 3]
3. next u input your constraint, eg. 3x1+4x2 < 5 ==> [3 4 5] ==> '<'
4. now search for biggest negative number in last row of an column
5. now choose the smallest positive number on ratio
6. repeat step 4 until u get the last row don't have any negative number
7. if u want stop just type 0 and u will stop

* for the M - method it's same like simpleks method but the M variabel we assume that is infinity

if u have any question or something want to ask leave it on comment
